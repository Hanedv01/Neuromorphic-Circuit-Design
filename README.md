# Neuromorphic-Circuit-Design
This repository contains code used to simulate an an artificial neuron circuit. It was developed as part of the course 1FA492 at Uppsala University, autumn 2025, and consists of two Python scripts. 

* [Hysteresis.py](https://github.com/Hanedv01/Neuromorphic-Circuit-Design/blob/main/Hysteresis.py) contains the class representing the hysteresis device, a key component of the circuit.
* [LIF-Circuit.py](https://github.com/Hanedv01/Neuromorphic-Circuit-Design/blob/main/LIF-Circuit.py) contains the code for the whole circuit, as well as help functions used in different simulations and their plotting.
